# to-do-list

The Odin Project // To-Do List project

-- This Project is part of the Odin Projects curriculum. --

Functionality I want to achieve:
Add/Remove To-Dos
Add Due Date
Add Priority
Multiple Projects/Lists
Local Storage

Optional:
Notes
Checklist
Sort by

Afterthoughts: I managed to achieve all functionality except the sort by, which I did not attempt yet. However I am pretty happy with how the project is looking right now, so I will skip this for now and might revisit at a later time. This was very difficult and the first "big" project I did, as there are a lot of moving parts and code interacting with each other. It was kind of hard to track at times. I think my code is not as efficiently organised as it could be, which is something I will have to work on in the future.

This took me a total of 16 hours.
